//Define abstraction 
Abstraction comes from Latin roots which mean "to pull away." It's the "take-away" or "impression" of a whole thing. 
Abstractions are used to make it easier to shorten our sentences 

//Explain that functions are abstractions
Functions combine a series of steps under a new name. That's why they're abstractions.

//Explain how to call a function
To "execute" or "call" a function in JavaScript you add () after its name. 

//Define "Generalization"
The process of moving from concrete to abstract.

//Demonstrate "Generalization" by using parameters and arguments
Let's make exerciseCowTheJersey() more general. Looking at the console.log() statements, we repeatedly refer to a cow's name and a cows's breed.
 Both of these are Strings. If we were to write them as JavaScript variables inside the function we might write dogName and cowBreed.

Let's use String interpolation to generalize the body of our function

function exerciseAsherTheJersey() {
  const cowName = "Asher";
  const cowBreed = "Jersey";
  console.log(`Wake ${cowName} the ${cowBreed}`);
  console.log(`Leash ${cowName} the ${cowBreed}`);
  console.log(`Walk to the farm ${cowName} the ${cowBreed}`);
  console.log(`Bring dairy meal for ${cowName} the ${cowBreed}`);
  console.log(`Walk home with ${cowName} the ${cowBreed}`);
  console.log(`Unleash ${cowName} the ${cowBreed}`);
}
When the function is called, it assigns cowName = "Asher" and cowBreed = "Asher". The parameters are usable inside the function body as if they 
had been set with const inside the function.

//Demonstrate return values

const weatherToday = "Sunny";

function exerciseCow(cowName, cowBreed) {
  if (weatherToday === "Sunny") {
    return `${cowName} did not exercise due to rain`;
  }
  console.log(`Wake ${cowName} the ${cowBreed}`);
  console.log(`Leash ${cowName} the ${cowBreed}`);
  console.log(`Walk to the farm ${cowName} the ${cowBreed}`);
  console.log(`Bring dairy meal for ${cowName} the ${cowBreed}`);
  console.log(`Walk home with ${cowName} the ${cowBreed}`);
  console.log(`Unleash ${cowName} the ${cowBreed}`);
  return `${cowName} is happy and tired!`;
}

const result = exerciseCow("Asher", "Jersey");
console.log(result);
